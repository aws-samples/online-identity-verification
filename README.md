# Amazon Rekognition online identity verification

A sample code to implement online identity verification flow with Amazon Rekognition.

This flow use Detectface Compareface and Face Liveness to detect real users and deter bad actors using spoofs in seconds during facial verification and check if real user face match identity verification doc face image .


## Architecture

![Architetcture](./docs/imgs/architecture.png)

## Components
Face Liveness uses multiple components:

* AWS Amplify SDK with FaceLivenessDetector component
* AWS SDKs
* AWS Cloud APIs


## Prerequisites


```sh
# Setup the AWS CLI
aws configure                                                                     
```

Locally installing on a workstation requires the following steps. 

1. Locally install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/ja-jp/) and Docker Daemon is running
1. Locally install AWS CDK as the [official documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html) describes.
1. [Bootstrap CDK for AWS Account](https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/blob/master/design/cdk-bootstrap.md) 
1. Install Python >=3.6 from [python.org](http://python.org/)
1. Create a Python virtual environment
  ```sh
  python3 -m venv .venv                                      
  ```

1. Activate virtual environment
  On MacOS or Linux
  ```sh
  source .venv/bin/activate                                       
  ```
  On Windows
  ```sh
    .venv\Scripts\activate.bat                                        
  ```



## Solution Deployment

The [one-click.sh](https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-rekognition-face-liveness/blob/main/one-click.sh) utility script is the recommended procedure for deploying a Rekognition Face Liveness(rfl) stack into an AWS Account.  It automates every step including installing missing dependency and executing all Out-Of-Band (OOB) operations.  Additionally, there is support for upgrading existing environments and seamlessly handling any future requirements.  


This table enumerates the overridable environment variables.  The deployment script supports deploying multiple stacks within the same account (but only us-east-1 region).  Additionally, the default settings support 200M unique faces.  Please contact us at rekognition-identity-verification@amazon.com for instructions beyond this threshold.  Lastly, AWS CloudFormation requires the Amazon S3 bucket and deployment only in us-east-1 region.  When these values differ the *create-stack* command fails with a descriptive error.

```sh

# Customers can deploy multiple instances (Prod vs Dev)
# If this value is not set then it defaults to 'Rfl-Prod'
# You control this functionality by setting the Landing Zone Name value
export RFL_STACK_NAME=Rfl-Prod

# Running this command will install any dependencies (brew, yum, or apt required)
# After preparing the local machine it will synthesize and deploy into your environment.
./one-click.sh
```


## How do I run the amplify app locally
#First create a .env.local file in the frontend directory with the following contents:

```
REACT_APP_ENV_API_URL=https://YOUR_API_GW_STAGE_URL
REACT_APP_IDENTITYPOOL_ID=AMAZON_COGNITO_IDENTITYPOOL_ID
REACT_APP_REGION=AMAZON_COGNITO_APP_REGION
REACT_APP_USERPOOL_ID=AMAZON_COGNITO_APP_USERPOOL_ID
REACT_APP_WEBCLIENT_ID=AMAZON_COGNITO_APP_WEBCLIENT_ID


```

#Install depedency and start the app

```
npm install
npm start

```


## How is the code organized


- [infra](infra).  CDK Automation for provisioning the environment(s)
  - [cropface](infra/cropface/).  detectface and crop face image backend triggered by  identity verification doc image upload
  - [facelivenessbackend](infra/facelivenessbackend/).  The RFL backend
  - [frontend](infra/frontend/). React Frontend Web App infra for Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness
- [src](src).  The backing code for Lambdas functions and other compute constructs
  - [liveness-session-result](src/backend/start-liveness-session/).  Backent to start the Face Liveness Session
  - [liveness-session-result](src/backend/liveness-session-result/).  Backent to get the Face Liveness Session Result
  - [frontend](src/frontend).  React Frontend Web App for Amazon Rekognition Face Liveness
